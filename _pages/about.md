Hello! I am a first-year PhD student in Computer and Communication Sciences ([EDIC](https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/edic-computer-and-communication-sciences/)) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/). My interests lie in programming languages, formal methods and software engineering. I'm currently doing my semester project at [LAMP](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lamp/).

<br />

<br />

Fun fact: my full name is **Yawen /jǎːwə́n/ Guan /kʷǣn/**. Many of my Chinese friends prefer to call me by my last name, then gradually they call me **Gwen** ;D Feel free to call me by either name!
