Welcome to my blog! 

In a Japenese anime Fate/Zero, Oceanus is the mythical endless sea, the end of the world, and Iskandar the King of Conqueror's ultimate goal. When Iskandar was killed, the mirage of Oceanus showed up in front of him. Overcome with emotion, he said:

<blockquote>
    So that's it... the beating of my hearts, is the sound of Oceanus' waves.
</blockquote>

Iskandar earned my full respect. I named my blog after this endless sea to remind myself how beautiful the desire to discover is :)

I don't care where life will take me to. The only fact I know is:

There will definitely be an unforgettable journey, and I can't wait to start it.
